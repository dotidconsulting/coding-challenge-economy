# Part 2 – Build a small web application

In this task you’ll need to build a small web application to display some data using the technology of your choice. It does not have to look pretty or doesn’t have to use any specific front end technology, use what you are comfortable with, we’ll evaluate your solution based on readability, simplicity, scalability and performance.

The data can be found in the [data folder](https://github.com/dotidconsulting/coding-challenge-economy/tree/main/part%202/data) of this repository

### Requirements:
- Put this data (SEIFA_2011 / SEIFA 2016) into a database, must be (any version of) SQL 
- Crreate a web application to present this data from the database. 
- Commit your work in a GIT repository or provide a zip folder containing all the files necessary so we can run them.

### Acceptance criteria:
- The web app should display the following info to the user:
--  place name 
--  state name 
--	SEIFA Disadvantage scores for 2016 and 2011 
--	a comparison of the 2016 and 2011 scores (difference)

- The web app should also:
--	display VIC results as default and 
--	allow the user to select a different state/territory and display new data accordingly (ie: dropdown)

GOOD LUCK!
